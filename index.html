    <p id="mission statement">My name is Charlie, and I have been on a computer since I was a toddler (maybe even before that).
        I have always been a problem-solver, so it made sense to take my knowledge of computers and combine
        it with that by going into the computer science field! I started this by taking some classes at my 
        local community college, which included completing a Java course. However, the pace and spread-out feel 
        of my courses left me wanting something more in depth and stimulating, so I opted for a different approach: 
        starting a software engineering bootcamp at Flatiron School! So far I have been learning some basic HTML, 
        CSS, and Javascript, and by the end of my course I will have all of the knowledge needed to pursue my 
        career as a Full-Stack Developer. Thank you for viewing the first of many projects I will complete in my 
        coursework!

    <p id="Mika paragraph">
        In addition to my love of computers, I am also a pet parent to one baby cat (read: 8 year old cat) named Mika. She has been in my life since she was 
        a kitten, when I was first on my own at age 18. I could go on about her all day, as she has been the most 
        important part of my life for the last 8 years now. But as the kids say, I will try to "keep it chill on main". 
        If you would like to see more about her (perhaps you area fellow cat-lover), please click here for more.
